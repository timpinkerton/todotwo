This is my project for the Code Louisville Thursday night Python class.

The project is a Todo app that allows the user the view a list of items, add new items, open a detailed view of a specific item, make edits to an item, and delete an item. 

This was created in Django 1.11 using Python 3.6, HTML, and CSS.

To view the application

    1. Clone the project from github
    2. pip install -r requirements.txt
    3. python manage.py runserver
